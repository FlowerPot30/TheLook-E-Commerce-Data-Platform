# 🛒TheLook E-Commerce-Data-Platform
A end-to-end Data Engineering Project built on Databricks and AWS S3, demonstrating a production-style Lakehouse architecture using the TheLook eCommerce public dataset.

## 📐 Data Architecture
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture)
- **Incremental ingestion** via Databricks Auto Loader, picks up new files automatically without reprocessing old data
- **Delta Lake** for ACID transactions and time travel all layers
- **Star Schema** on Gold layer optimized for analytical queries
- **Delta Live Tables** for pipeline orchestration with built-in quality expectations

## 📂 Dataset ##
**Original Source**: [TheLook E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafakeser4/looker-ecommerce-bigquery-dataset), but we would like to show Streaming Ingestion method, so we split the datas by year. You can get the splited dataset from datasets folder.

A fictional eCommerce clothing store developed by the Google Looker team, containing 7 tables:
| Table | Type | Split Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `orders` | Fact | By year |
| `order_items` | Fact | By year |
| `inventory_items` | Fact | By year |
| `events` | Fact | By year |
| `users` | Dimension | By year |
| `products` | Dimension | Single file |
| `distribution_centers` | Dimension | Single file |

Files are split by year to simulate **Incremental data arrival** - mimicking how data lands in a real production environment.
